;;If b is given a value then a must be the square root of b, and this must be true of both inputs m1 m2.
;;With the multiplier, suppose a = 0 and b is set to 4. We wish for a to be set to 2.
;;Note that b would not be set at 0 because b's informant is not this squarer constraint, but is some other
;;constraint that set it to 4. Possibly by the user.
