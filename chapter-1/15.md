```
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine .45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine .15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine .05))))))
```
The procedure `p` is applied $n$ times where $n$ satisfies $12.15/3^n$, and $12.15/3^n$ is the closest number $< 0.1$. That is, `p` is applied $5$ times in this case.
