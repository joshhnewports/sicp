# 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Solution

Using the first procedure, we evaluate
```
1 ]=> (+ 4 5)

(if (= 4 0)
    5
    (inc (+ (dec 4) 5)))

(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))

(inc (+ 3 5))

(inc (if (= 3 0)
         5
         (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))))

(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))

(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))

(inc (inc (if (= 2 0)
              5
              (inc (+ (dec 2) 5)))))

(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))

(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))

(inc (inc (inc (if (= 1 0)
                   5
                   (inc (+ (dec 1) 5))))))

(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))

(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))

(inc (inc (inc (inc (if (= 0 0)
                        5
                        (inc (+ (dec 0) 5)))))))

(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))

(inc (inc (inc 6)))

(inc (inc 7))

(inc 8)

;Value: 9
```

The interpreter must remember the operations that are deferred, thus the first procedure generates a recursive process. Observe that the shape of the process expands and contracts, as well.

Using the second procedure, we evaluate
```
1 ]=> (+ 4 5)

(if (= 4 0)
    5
    (+ (dec 4) (inc 5)))

(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))

(+ 3 (inc 5))

(+ 3 6)

(if (= 3 0)
    6
    (+ (dec 3) (inc 6)))

(+ (dec 3) (inc 6))

(+ 2 (inc 6))

(+ 2 7)

(if (= 2 0)
    7
    (+ (dec 2) (inc 7)))

(+ (dec 2) (inc 7))

(+ 1 (inc 7))

(+ 1 8)

(if (= 1 0)
    8
    (+ (dec 1) (inc 8)))

(+ (dec 1) (inc 8))

(+ 0 (inc 8))

(+ 0 9)

(if (= 0 0)
    9
    (+ (dec 0) (inc 9)))

;Value: 9
```

The state of the process is always known by the values of the state variables. The second procedure generates an iterative process.
